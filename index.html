            <p>My name is Jeanine, and I created Love and Lemons to celebrate how nourishing, fun, and delicious cooking with seasonal fruits and vegetables can be. I hope that the recipes here inspire you to try cooking a new vegetable, or try cooking a familiar vegetable in a new way.

            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                You’ll find a host of inventive vegetarian recipes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but I also want Love and Lemons to be a resource for you. We have guides to working with vegetables ranging from spaghetti squash to asparagus and tips for cooking plant-based basics like quinoa, rice, and lentils.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                And after all those veggies, I always save room for dessert! In my opinion, healthy eating is all about balance, so you’ll find recipes for brownies, cakes, cookies, and more here too.
